# Issam Leaning GenAI
In this repo I try to document my GenAI learning journey. For each course I will trake, i will try to summarize(sometimes copy/paste) the content and write the code examples.

## Here is the list of course I'm taking:
1. [Generative AI for Everyone](./generative-ai-for-everyone/)
2. [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](./chatgpt-prompt/)
3. [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](./chapgt-systems-api/)
